\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a coffee pot, measure and pour in approximately 3oz (100ml) of cold water for each cup.
    \item For each cup, mix in 1 heaping teaspoon of very finely ground coffee. If desired, also mix in 1 teaspoon of sugar per each cup. Optional: add or grind cardamom in the coffee pot after adding the coffee for flavor.
    \item On medium heat bring to an almost boil. However, do not let it boil.
    \item Once froth rises, remove from heat and serve.
\end{enumerate}

Dan buys his coffee from Henry's House of Coffee based in California\footnote{https://henryshouseofcoffee.com/collections/soorj}. When he buys from Adonis, he asks them to grind some cardamom at the same time with the coffee.
