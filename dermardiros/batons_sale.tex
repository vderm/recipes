\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients except the egg and nigella seeds. Add an additional flour if needed to obtain a non-sticky soft yet pliable dough.
    \item Shape into 4-5 inch thin ropes. Fold each rope in half then form a twisted rope.
    \item Place on baking sheet lined with parchment.
    \item Lightly brush with egg wash and sprinkle with nigella seeds.
    \item Bake at 350\degree F for about 30 minutes.
\end{enumerate}

    Sybil’s trick: You can freeze 2/3 of the cookies once they have baked and cooled.
