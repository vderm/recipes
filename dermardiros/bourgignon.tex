\textit{Beef stew with carrots and potatoes}

Family member: Sybil

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Preheat oven to 350\degree F.
    \item In a large hot pan, cook the chopped onions with a knob of butter until soft. Add the mushrooms and continue cooking for a few minutes, then add the carrots. Continue cooking on medium heat.
    \item In another large pan, melt some butter on medium heat and add the meat, season with salt and pepper. Cook until brown and caramelized. Add the meat on top of the cooked vegetables.
    \item In a bowl, mix the flour and the broth with a whisk until there are no lumps. Stir this mix onto the vegetables and meat, then add the chopped potatoes to the pan. Combine well and cook for 10~minutes.
    \item Transfer all the mix to a Creuset dutch oven. Add the bay leaves, crushed garlic and the brown sugar.
    \item Put the Creuset in the preheated oven, and cook for 2~hours. At this point, check to see if the meat is tender enough, if not, return to the oven for another hour.
\end{enumerate}

You can use red wine instead of the Red Wine broth if you like. Sybil's trick: When removing from the oven after 2~hours, add a splash of Cognac!
