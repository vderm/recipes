\begin{enumerate}
    \item Follow the instructions on the chocolate pudding box.
    \item In a Pyrex or other baking dish, place tea biscuits to make a layer. You may need to break some cookies to cover all the bottom.
    \item While the pudding mixture is still hot, pour a thin layer on top of the cookies.
    \item Repeat layering cookies and pudding until desired height and finish with a layer of pudding at the very top.
    \item Refrigerate overnight.
\end{enumerate}
