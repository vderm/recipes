Family member: Nene Hermine

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a small bowl, mix the breadcrumbs with 1~tbsp of milk. If too thick, add another tablespoon. You want the mix to be like a runny paste.
    \item In a large bowl, add the ground beef, chopped parsley, breadcrumb slurry and a pinch of cinnamon. Season with salt and pepper, combine well.
    \item Shape the mixture into elongated ovals, in the shape of the picture in the margin. Place the shaped meatballs on a plate.
    \item Heat a pan with oil. Once hot, one by one, roll the meatballs in flour and fry. Serve hot!
\end{enumerate}
