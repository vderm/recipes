    \item In a medium bowl, mix ground beef, rice, onion, salt and pepper.
    \item Place teared cabbage leaves at the bottom of a large wide pot. Roll dolma with meat filling and place each into the pot tightly together, seam-side down. Make 2 layers at most.
    \item Mix 1 cup of water to 3/4 cup Passata and add it to the pot containing the dolma.
    \item Place the pot on the stove, cover and heat on high. Reduce the heat once simmering and cook for 30-40min.

\marginnote{
    If have leftover meat mixture, can make kept balls or fill some tomatoes and place them next to the rolled dolma to cook together.
    Can be frozen after cooking/cooling.
    If using 1 whole savoy cabbage, double the filling quantities.
