\begin{enumerate}
    \item Chop onion and cook in a medium pot for 1-2~minutes until soft.
    \item Add lean ground beef, salt, pepper and Armenian pepper.
    \item Cook until little or no water is left from the meat.

    % TODO: did we want to split this up into sections?
    \item In a large bowl, mix flour and salt.
    \item Mix in milk using a spoon. Add 1~cup water and mix with hands.
    \item Add a little oil to hands to help dough unstick.
    \item Add ¼ to ½~cup water slowly while mixing, until you get a soft dough.
    \item You can add up to 2~handfuls of oil.

    \item Flatten dough using a rolling pin or a pasta machine.
    \item Cut into 1.5-inch squares, fill with some meat and pinch sides.
    \item Place month on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between each.
    \item Cook at 350\degree F for about 30~minutes, until evenly browned.
    \item Eat with yogurt, sriracha and sprinkle with sumac!
\end{enumerate}

After first cooking in oven, Sybil would normally cook them in a broth and eat as a soup. You can top with a little yogurt in there too!
Can store cooked in bags in the freezer, reheat in oven before eating.
