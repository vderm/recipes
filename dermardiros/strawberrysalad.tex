\begin{enumerate}
    \item Preheat your oven to 350\degree F. Spread the pecans evenly onto a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until they begin to brown and become aromatic, making sure to toss halfway through. Remove from the oven and let cool.
    \item In the meantime, place the arugula in a chilled large salad bowl.
    \item Wash and slice the strawberries and add them to the bowl.
    \item In a cup, prepare your dressing by combining the olive oil, balsamic vinegar and maple syrup.
    \item Once the pecans have cooled off, add them to salad bowl and toss the salad with the dressing.
