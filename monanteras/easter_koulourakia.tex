\newthought{Grandma} \textgreek{Ελένη} would make \textgreek{κουλουράκια} every Easter. They are best eaten soon after baking with a coffee or dipped in milk. Since she made a large batch, she would keep them stored in Tupperwares, which made them soft. We all preferred them that way!

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a large bowl, mix the flour with the baking powder and vanilla powder (if using).
    \item In bowl, beat the egg whites with a small amount of sugar using a mixer to obtain a meringue. Place in the fridge.
    \item Warm milk, remove from the heat and add ammonia powder. Stir until it foams and set it aside. Be careful - it smells strong!
    \item Using a mixer, beat the egg yolks with the remaining sugar, slowly add the melted butter and foamy milk/ammonia while mixing. Using a spatula, fold in the egg whites.
    \item Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, add as much as the dry as needed (normally use 3 1/2 - 4~cups).
    \item Mix with a spatula (or hands), scrape the sides of the bowl. Add very little oil to hands and mix with hands to form a dough. It should unstick from the bowl.
    \item Shape into balls, then thin ropes and twists, pretzels and koulouria.
    \item Place on baking sheets lined with parchment, brush with the reserved egg yolks and sprinkle with almond flakes.
    \item Bake at 350\degree F for 8~minutes, turn the baking sheet and for another 6-8~minutes.
\end{enumerate}
