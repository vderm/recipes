\textit{Lentil soup}

Family member: Mom

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Soak lentils in cold water overnight (around 12~hours). The next day, drain out the water using a sieve.
    \item In a medium pot, grate onion and add 3~tbsp olive oil.
    \item Heat on high and cook until the onion is soft. Add drained lentils and cook.
    \item Add the tomato sauce. Bring the pot over the sink and fill half the pot with water.
    \item Continue heating, add the bay leaves, salt, garlic and carrots if using. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to Medium to keep to a simmer.
    \item Simmer until the soup thickens and lentils are cooked, about 1~hour and 30~minutes.
\end{enumerate}

Eat with toasted sourdough bread and a piece of feta! Normally we halve this recipe and add paprika and pepper for taste. You can also add the garlic while browning the onions.
