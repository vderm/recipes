Family member: Mom

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Soak the beans in cold water overnight, around 12~hours.
    \item The next day, drain out the water using a sieve and rinse them. Put them in a pot of water and bring it to a boil. Cover the pot, simmer for around 30~minutes until they are almost tender. Drain the beans and set them aside.
    \item Meanwhile, in a medium pot, heat 3~tbsp olive oil and add the chopped onion. Cook on low heat, stirring occasionally, until it is soft.
    \item Add drained beans and stir very well. Add the carrots, celery, 1~can of Heinz tomato juice and 4~cans of water. Stir well and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper.
    \item Reduce the heat and cover. Leave the soup simmer for 1-2~hours until the beans are tender and the soup has thickened.
    \item Check frequently during cooking and add more water if needed.
