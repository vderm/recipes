\newthought{We have} spent many family dinners at my parent's house discussing the softness of the \textgreek{κοκκινιστό}, so much that we have nicknamed this dish "Soft Tender Meat"!

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a medium pot, heat some oil and cook the cubes of meat until they are brown all over. Remove the meat onto a plate and set aside.
    \item Add some olive oil and once hot, cook the grated onion for 2-3 minutes until it has softened.
    \item Return the meat to the pot, add the tomato sauce and about 2 cans of water. Stir well and season with salt and pepper.
    \item Reduce the heat, and simmer, adding a little water if needed from time to time, for 1 1/2 hours, until the meat is tender and the sauce has thickened.
    \item Serve hot on top of rice!
\end{enumerate}
