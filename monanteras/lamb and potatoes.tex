\begin{enumerate}
    \item Preheat oven to 350\degree F.
    \item Prepare the leg of lamb: cut the leg into pieces or leave it whole and add it to a large bowl.  Add olive oil, salt, freshly ground pepper and oregano on all its sides, and toss it well. Pierce the leg with a knife and put the pieces of garlic inside. Place the lamb in a large baking dish or roasting pan.
