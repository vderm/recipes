\newthought{These potatoes} are the lemon potatoes you are probably thinking of! Melt-in-your-mouth oven roasted potatoes, so lemony and delicious.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Preheat oven to 350\degree F.
    \item Put the potato wedges in a large bowl. Drizzle some olive oil, salt, pepper and oregano. Toss them well and transfer them to an ovenproof dish.
    \item Pour the lemon juice on the potatoes, then add 1 cup of water.
    \item Place in the oven uncovered for about 1 hour. Check occasionally, basting the potatoes. If necessary, add some more water during cooking.
    \item Bake until the potatoes are soft and can be pierced easily with a knife.
\end{enumerate}
