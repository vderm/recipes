\begin{enumerate}
    \item Heat oil in a medium to large sized saucepot and cook the onion.
    \item Add the minced meat and cook well, until browned. Add the tomato juice, salt and pepper. Using the Heinz tomato juice can, add 2~cans of water to the pot and stir. Cover the pot and allow to cook over medium heat for approximately 1~hour.
    \item When the sauce has thickened and is almost ready, add the jar of Catelli Garden Select and stir very well. Cover the pot and let it cook for 30-45~minutes.
    \item The sauce is ready when it starts to thicken. Boil your pasta: add 1~tsp of salt to a pot of boiling water and prepare the spaghetti according to the instructions on the package.
    \item Top with meat sauce and sprinkle with lots of pecorino cheese. ENJOY :)
\end{enumerate}

We found that using 650~g of ground beef, half the jar of Catelli and half the tomato juice can, makes enough for 2~people, with lots of leftovers. It took us a little over an hour to cook half the quantity - Elsa \& Vaski
