Family member: Grandma Elisavet

\newthought{Grandma Elisavet} would make \textgreek{πατάτες με αυγά} often for my dad and uncle when they were little. It was a meal that was easily put together and can sustain you for hours! Everytime we would visit our house in Dara, grandma would always have a place ready for us when we arrived because she knew we had travelled a long way and were hungry.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Peel and cut the potatoes into wedges. Place them in a bowl of cold water.
    \item Heat a large frying pan, add some olive oil. When hot, add the potatoes and fry them. Once cooked, remove and set them aside on a plate.
    \item Add the eggs to the hot pan, mix them while they cook (scramble them).
    \item As the eggs cook, add back the potatoes. Continue mixing with a spatula while the eggs cook.
    \item Put the potatoes and eggs onto a large place and sprinkle lots of grated cheese. Serve warm!
\end{enumerate}
