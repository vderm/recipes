Family member: Elsa \& Vaski

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a large bowl, add the butter. Sift the icing sugar and the cocoa powder over the butter and whisk until you form a paste. Add the salt and the orange zest, and mix until they are well combined.
    \item In another bowl, crush the the cookies into large pieces. Add the brandy and mix by squeezing lightly with your hands to crush the cookies some more. Transfer the cookies to the bowl with the cocoa powder and mix using a spatula.
    \item Spread the mixture on a large piece of parchment paper and wrap into a tight roll. If too long, you can choose to form 2 rolls. Wrap with plastic wrap tightly and twist the ends like a candy to obtain an even shape.
    \item Refrigerate for 3-4 hours before slicing and serving! The extra salami can be frozen.
\end{enumerate}
